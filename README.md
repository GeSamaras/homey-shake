# togeprii

This repo helps you quickly set up a fresh Linux install (Fedora KDE and Mint tested) for development, media, and homelab tinkering. These are tools i personally use and want in my system by default. So, while the configurations might not be pristine and standardized, the point is to get a new machine up and running with all the useful stuff i personally want (bloatðŸ¤ ). It uses a mix of bash scripts and Docker to get everything installed and configured, and i highly encourage for you to add and tweak your own fork with things you like! 

---
## How it Works:

You'll clone this repo, run the main script, and it'll handle installing system packages, desktop apps, development tools, and setting up Docker containers.

---
### Prerequisites

- Debian/Ubuntu or Fedora system.
- git.
- `sudo` privileges: The scripts need root access to install software.

---

# DISCLAIMER!

This is meant for personal use. Be cautious when running scripts unless you trust and understand them!

First read the scripts and how they work, and test it on a virtual machine before running on your local computer.

By the way, throughout this project i warn caution when running any script, however i advise to only consider using this repo if you're fairly familiar and comfortable with bash scripts and Linux.

---

## Clone the Repo:

```bash
# First, make sure git is installed
sudo dnf install -y git
git clone https://github.com/GeSamaras/togeprii.git ~/togeprii
cd ~/togeprii
# Recommended to read all the scripts top to bottom.
cat setup.sh
cat install_system.sh
# And so on
```

## Review the Scripts (RECOMMENDED!):

Take a good look at setup.sh and any sub-scripts (like install_system.sh, install_apps.sh, setup_docker.sh) to see what they'll do. Never run scripts you don't trust!

## Make Scripts Executable:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh *.sh
```

Use code with caution.

## Run the Main Setup Script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Follow on-screen prompts when asked. Some installations (like Miniconda or Oh My Zsh) might ask for confirmation. You'll likely need to enter your sudo password.

Reboot or Re-login: After the script finishes, reboot or log out and back in. This is crucial for changes like adding your user to the docker group to take effect.

3. Containerization:

- **Docker**:
Â  Â  - Docker Engine
Â  Â  - Docker CLI
Â  Â  - Docker Compose (v2+)

(Installs Docker Desktop for Linux, which bundles these)

Adds your user to the docker group (requires re-login!).


4. Docker Containers / Stacks (via Docker Compose):

**Location**: Compose files (docker-compose.yml) and configurations will be placed in ~/homelab-docker/ by default.

**Setup**: The script will copy the template docker-compose.yml files. It will NOT automatically start them. You need to:

Navigate to the specific service directory (e.g., cd ~/homelab-docker/jellyfin-stack).

Review and customize the docker-compose.yml file (check ports, volumes, environment variables). You might need to create .env files for secrets.

Run docker compose up -d to start the stack in the background.
